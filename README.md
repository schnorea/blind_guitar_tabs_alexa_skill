# blind_guitar_tabs_alexa_skill
This Alexa skill is proposed to assist the visually impaired with access to guitar and other tablature through a voice interface.

Currently there is no code here but an idea that would like helpers to get it built

## Idea:
Knowing some folks with the degenerative eye disease macular degeneration and I can see the writing on the wall (bad pun) that they will have to have an outlet to learn new songs when their vision degrades.

Adding a feature to a web based tabs site interface or to Alexa to speak the tablature and perhaps to control the playback of the tabs would be really useful.

Think an Alexa like skill - Here is a example dialog

User: "Alexa, ask Ultimate Guitar (just saying they have most of the backend for this) to play bass line of Let's Groove by Earth, Wind and Fire."

Alexa: "Let's Groove by Earth, Wind and Fire, bass tabs on Ultimate Guitar"

Alexa: "Would you like accompaniment?"

User: "just Drums and bass tabs"

Alexa: "A note here if tabs are requested the tempo of the music will be decreased to allow their annunciation.  When tabs are remove tempo will be increased to desired level. If you would not like to hear this note again say "Remove, tab note""

Alexa with beat or measure sounds: " boom,boom,boom, E0, E3, E5, E3, E2, A2,A0,A2,E0...."

User: "Stop, Loop back 4 measures, Start"

Alexa with beat or measure sounds: " boom,boom,boom, E0, E3, E5, E3, E2, A2,A0,A2,E0...."

User: "Start from beginning"

Alexa with beat or measure sounds: " boom,boom,boom, E0, E3, E5, E3, E2, A2,A0,A2,E0...."

User: "Stop, what parts can I loop"

Alexa: "For this song you can loop, verse, bridge and outro"

User: "Loop bridge"

Alexa with beat or measure sounds: " boom,boom,boom, D7, D7, D8, D9, A5,A6,A7,A7...."

User: "Stop, adjust accompaniment"

Alexa: "Options for this song are:  kazoo, drums, spoons, bass, guitar, piano, ..."

User: "Accompany with guitar and drums"

Alexa: "ping"

User: "Adjust speed to 1/2 and start"
